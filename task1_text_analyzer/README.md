# Task 1 – Smart Text Analyzer (Python)

Simple function that takes a text string and returns:
- total word count
- average word length (rounded to 2 decimals)
- list of longest word(s)
- word frequency (case‑insensitive)

## Example

```python
from text_analyzer import analyze_text

text = "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog the fox"
result = analyze_text(text)
print(result)
```

You can also just run `text_analyzer.py` directly to see some example outputs.

## How to run

```bash
python3 text_analyzer.py
```

No extra libraries needed, just Python 3.

## More details

See `DOCUMENTATION.md` for my approach, searches, edge cases, etc.
